# zzzss

Sleepy style

## Usage

The consumable CSS is found in "dist/css/zzzss.css". You can pull this into your project in any number of ways. To see how I'm doing it in a React project, check out my [Style Guide](https://github.com/BillyZac/style-guide/). In that case, I'm using relying on Webpack to inject the CSS into the bundled Javascript.
